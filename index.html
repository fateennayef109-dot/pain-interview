// ── QUESTIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    section: "Identity & Soul",
    q: "Let's start at the core. If you had to describe the Centre in exactly 3 words — not what it does, but the feeling it gives off — what would those words be? For example: rigorous, human, pioneering. Take your time with this one, it shapes everything that follows.",
    ack: [
      "Those words say a lot — that sense of {answer} is a powerful foundation to build a visual identity on.",
      "Interesting choices. {answer} already tells a clear story about how the Centre wants to be perceived.",
      "That's a strong set. {answer} — each of those words will directly inform the design direction."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Identity & Soul",
    q: "Imagine the Centre as a person walking into a room. How do they carry themselves? How do they speak — are they the confident scientist at the whiteboard, the empathetic clinician who sits with patients, the quiet visionary who sees what others miss?",
    ack: [
      "That's a vivid picture — and a really useful one for a designer to understand the tone.",
      "That character comes through clearly. It'll be important to make sure the visual identity reflects that same presence.",
      "That kind of clarity about personality is exactly what separates a good rebrand from a great one."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Identity & Soul",
    q: "What would be lost if the Centre disappeared tomorrow? Not in terms of research output — but what gap would exist in the world, in people's lives?",
    ack: [
      "That's the kind of answer that should be on the website. It captures something essential.",
      "That gap you're describing — that's the Centre's real value proposition, and it's more compelling than any list of publications.",
      "Powerful. That sense of purpose is what the new identity needs to radiate."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Logo & Iconography",
    q: "When you think of the Centre's work — pain, the brain, sensory experience, human connection — what images, shapes, or symbols naturally come to mind? Don't filter yourself, nothing is too abstract or too literal.",
    ack: [
      "Some really interesting territory there — a designer will find a lot to work with in what you just described.",
      "That mix of the literal and the abstract is actually where the best logomarks tend to come from.",
      "Good — those raw associations are exactly what we need before any design decisions are made."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Logo & Iconography",
    q: "Many pain and neuroscience centres lean on predictable imagery — brain silhouettes, neural networks, DNA strands. Does any of that feel right for you, or does it feel too generic? Are there symbols from completely different fields — nature, architecture, mathematics — that resonate more?",
    ack: [
      "That instinct to move away from the obvious is usually the right one — the most memorable marks tend to come from unexpected places.",
      "Noted on what to avoid. That clarity is just as valuable as knowing what you want.",
      "That's a useful distinction — and it gives the designer real creative freedom to find something original."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Logo & Iconography",
    q: "For the logo mark itself: do you want a standalone symbol that can exist without the name — like Nike or Apple — a wordmark where the name is the logo, or a combination of both? And should it feel geometric and precise, or more organic and fluid?",
    ack: [
      "That direction makes sense for where the Centre is right now — a combination mark gives flexibility across different contexts.",
      "A wordmark can be incredibly powerful when the typography is right. Good call.",
      "Geometric vs organic is one of the most fundamental decisions in logo design — knowing your preference early saves a lot of back and forth."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Logo & Iconography",
    q: "What do you specifically dislike about the current logo — the font, the colour, the icon, the proportions, the overall feeling it gives? Be as direct as you like. This is exactly the feedback that makes a rebrand successful.",
    ack: [
      "That's really useful — knowing what's broken is half the battle.",
      "Brutal honesty is the best brief. Everything you just said goes straight into the designer's notes.",
      "Good — that kind of specific feedback will save weeks of iteration."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Colour",
    q: "Colour is one of the most powerful brand signals. When you imagine the Centre's new visual world, what colours come to mind instinctively? And equally important: are there any colours that feel completely wrong — too clinical, too cold, too corporate?",
    ack: [
      "Colour instincts are often more reliable than colour theory — what you just described gives us a real emotional direction.",
      "The colours to avoid are just as important as the colours you want. That's a helpful boundary to set early.",
      "That combination of attraction and aversion is a great starting point for building a palette."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Colour",
    q: "I want to share some colour directions that branding research in healthcare and neuroscience suggests work well — what's your gut reaction to each? Deep navy or midnight blue signals trust, depth, intelligence. Warm slate or charcoal feels modern, serious, approachable. Muted teal or sage reads calm, scientific, human. A warmer palette — ochre, sand, warm white — conveys warmth, hope, humanity. Any of those feel closer to the truth of the Centre?",
    ack: [
      "That reaction tells me a lot. The research backs that direction up for medical and neuroscience organisations.",
      "Interesting — that's a less common choice in this space, which could actually work in your favour.",
      "Good instinct. That palette direction has strong precedent in credible scientific institutions."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Colour",
    q: "Should the colour feel bold and confident — owning the space — or restrained and refined, letting the work speak for itself? And do you see a single strong primary colour, or a palette of two or three working together?",
    ack: [
      "Restraint often communicates more confidence than boldness in academic and medical branding. Good instinct.",
      "A bold single colour can be very ownable — especially if no one else in your space is using it.",
      "A two-colour palette with one dominant and one accent tends to be the most versatile for institutions like this."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Typography & Brand Voice",
    q: "Typography carries as much personality as colour. Research in medical branding shows serif fonts signal authority and trust, while clean sans-serifs signal modernity and accessibility. Many strong brands pair both. When you read a headline from the Centre, what should the type feel like: classic and authoritative, modern and clean, or a confident bridge between the two?",
    ack: [
      "That preference will shape every headline, every publication, every slide deck the Centre produces.",
      "The bridge approach is increasingly common in research institutions — it lets you speak to both peers and the public.",
      "A strong type system is often what makes an academic brand feel modern without losing credibility."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Typography & Brand Voice",
    q: "Now let's talk about how the Centre speaks — its voice. Which direction feels closest: precise and academic, warm and accessible, or a confident bridge between both? And are there any words, phrases, or ways of talking about the Centre that you want to retire completely?",
    ack: [
      "Voice is often the last thing organisations think about and the first thing audiences notice. Good to define it clearly.",
      "Those phrases to retire are gold — knowing what sounds wrong is just as useful as knowing what sounds right.",
      "That voice direction will inform not just the website but every piece of communication the Centre puts out."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Competitors & References",
    q: "Think about other pain research groups, neuroscience centres, or university labs — in Canada or internationally. Are there any whose brand, visual identity, or reputation you genuinely admire? And are there any you specifically want to be visually or tonally different from?",
    ack: [
      "Knowing who you admire and who you want to distance yourself from is one of the most useful inputs a designer can have.",
      "That competitive awareness will help position the Centre's identity clearly in a crowded space.",
      "Useful benchmarks — both as inspiration and as a reminder of what to avoid."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Competitors & References",
    q: "Now think broader — outside academia entirely. Are there any organisations, companies, or brands in any field whose visual identity or communication style you find compelling? A tech company, a cultural institution, a publication, a clinic. What draws you to them?",
    ack: [
      "Cross-industry references are often where the most original ideas come from. Good ones.",
      "That's an interesting set of references — there's a clear aesthetic sensibility running through them.",
      "Those references tell me something important about the level of design sophistication you're aiming for."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Competitors & References",
    q: "If you had to place the Centre on a spectrum — on one end, a prestigious traditional academic institution like Johns Hopkins or the Salk Institute, on the other, a modern purpose-driven organisation like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — where does the Centre sit today, and where do you want it to sit?",
    ack: [
      "That gap between where you are and where you want to be is exactly what the rebrand needs to close.",
      "That's a clear and honest positioning. Most organisations struggle to articulate that gap.",
      "Knowing that aspiration gives the designer a specific target to aim for — not just aesthetically but strategically."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Constraints & Final Thoughts",
    q: "Practically speaking — does the new identity need to visually connect to the University of Toronto in any way, such as referencing their colours or seal? Or does the Centre have the freedom to stand fully on its own?",
    ack: [
      "That constraint — or that freedom — will significantly shape what's possible. Good to know now.",
      "Having that autonomy is a real asset. It means the designer isn't working within someone else's system.",
      "Understood. That affiliation still matters but doesn't have to dictate the design — there are elegant ways to reference it."
    ]
  },
  {
    section: "Constraints & Final Thoughts",
    q: "Last question, and it matters: is there anything about the current identity — a colour, a phrase, a feeling — that you actually want to keep? And is there anything else about this rebrand, something we haven't touched on, that you want me to know?",
    ack: [
      "Thank you for that. Knowing what to preserve is just as important as knowing what to change.",
      "That last point is really valuable context — it's exactly the kind of thing that often gets missed.",
      "Perfect. That rounds out the picture beautifully."
